# Contentful

Contentful is content infrastructure. Our platform lets you create, manage and distribute content to any platform. Unlike a CMS, we give you total freedom to create your own content model so you can decide which content you want to manage. We provide you RESTful APIs so you can deliver your content across multiple channels such as websites, mobile apps (iOS, Android and Windows Phone) or any other platform you can imagine (from Google Glass to infinity). With an uncluttered user interface, Contentful is an efficient tool for creating and managing your content online, either alone or in team. Assign custom roles and permissions to team members, add validations depending on the kind of content you have to insert and add media such as images, documents, sounds or video.
